# The Sims 2 NDS & GBA Soundtrack v1.0.1

## https://mods.sm64coopdx.com/mods/the-sims-2-nds-gba-soundtrack.171/

Audio files are not in this folder. You must download the official version on the sm64coopdx website.

This is a modified version of the mod to work with the Song API. (And it was also used during the testing process in the API development.)

Delete everything from the mod folder and just keep the `sound` folder. And place the `main.lua` file inside the folder.
